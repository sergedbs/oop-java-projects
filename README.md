# **OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING JAVA PROJECTS**

This repository contains various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects implemented in Java. Each project
demonstrates key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## **Projects Overview**

### **[01. Intro into Classification](projects/01-intro-classification)**

A classification system that categorizes individuals into fictional universes using rules based on their traits,
implemented with OOP design and JSON handling.

### **[02. Working with Classes](projects/02-working-with-classes)**

A project demonstrating class structures, JSON handling, text processing, and comparisons through various tasks
including a virtual assistant.

### **[03. Introducing Inheritance](projects/03-introducing-inheritance)**

A coffee shop simulation that implements inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and encapsulation with an animated
terminal UI using JLine.

### **[04. Abstraction and Polymorphism](projects/04-abstraction-polymorphism)**

A project focused on abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphic behaviors to create modular and reusable Java
components.

### **[Common Library](projects/common)**

A shared library of reusable components for JSON operations, file handling, argument parsing, text loading, and
terminal-based UI utilities.
